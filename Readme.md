-to store images and files we will use cloudinary,aws,azure, or any other cloud storage service
-so firstly we upload the photos temporarily to the local storage or server and then we upload them to the cloud storage service
-why because say we a user lose connection to the internet while uploading the file, we can still save the file locally and then upload it later
-when we upload the file to the cloud storage service, we will get a url for that file, and we will store that url in our database

//whatever files related to node js we will put in gitignore file
//any other files that you don't want to push to the git repository, you can put them in the gitignore file
